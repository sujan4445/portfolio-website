        <h1>Phenotyping Wheat Under Drought: Unlocking Resilience for Future Harvests</h1>

        <p>Drought stress remains one of the biggest challenges to wheat production worldwide, especially in rainfed agricultural systems. To secure food supplies amid changing climates, scientists and breeders focus on phenotyping—the detailed measurement of observable plant traits—to identify wheat varieties that can thrive under limited water.</p>

        <h2>What is Phenotyping?</h2>
        <p>Phenotyping involves assessing key traits such as leaf wilting, root depth, biomass, relative water content, and grain yield under drought conditions. These traits reflect the plant’s ability to conserve water, maintain photosynthesis, and complete its life cycle despite water scarcity.</p>

        <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
        <p>Traditional breeding relied heavily on yield data alone, but drought tolerance is complex, controlled by multiple genes influencing various traits. Accurate phenotyping helps pinpoint drought-adaptive traits and guides breeders in selecting wheat lines with superior performance during dry spells.</p>

        <h2>Field Phenotyping Methods</h2>
        <p>In field trials, wheat genotypes are grown under controlled drought conditions. Researchers monitor traits like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relative Water Content (RWC):</strong> Indicates hydration status of leaves.</li>
            <li><strong>Stomatal Conductance:</strong> Reflects water loss and gas exchange.</li>
            <li><strong>Root Architecture:</strong> Deeper roots can access moisture from lower soil layers.</li>
            <li><strong>Canopy Temperature:</strong> Cooler canopies often signify better water use.</li>
            <li><strong>Grain Yield and Harvest Index:</strong> Final indicators of drought tolerance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced Tools</h2>
        <p>Modern phenotyping uses remote sensing technologies—drones with multispectral cameras, thermal imaging, and high-throughput platforms—to capture data efficiently over large areas, improving accuracy and saving time.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Wheat Breeding</h2>
        <p>Data from phenotyping enables breeders to develop drought-resilient wheat varieties tailored to specific environments. These varieties maintain stable yields, reduce risk for farmers, and contribute to sustainable agriculture under climate uncertainty.</p>
